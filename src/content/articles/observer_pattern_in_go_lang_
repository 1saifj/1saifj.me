## Introduction

Although go is not an oop language, it can be applicable to design patterns too, in this blog, I will guide you through an extensive explanation of how to use observer patterns in golang.
first of all, the observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern. the observer pattern is defined in the [the Gang of four books](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns)
defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
